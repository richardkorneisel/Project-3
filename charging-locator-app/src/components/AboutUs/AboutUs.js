            <p>Hello! This app was designed by three individuals who wanted to give an individual a useful tool to locate charging stations for their electric vehicles.  As we all know, electric vehicles are our future, so this webapage will ask for you to provide just a few pieces of information, and will then display a list of charging stations starting with the closest based on your input.</p>
            <p>To run this app you will need to know the latitude and longitude of the location you wish to search for charging stations (For example: Chicago, IL has a latitude of 41.8756 and a longitude of -87.6244)</p>
